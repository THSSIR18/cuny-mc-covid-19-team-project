this project was and stil is prevalent to today. it calculates the number of deaths and cases from COVID-19 in different counties within NY. we decided to to further our research on New York City and noticed two key analyses: (1) with the vaccine released, cases were still rising in the last 30 days and (2) there was a direct correlation between deaths and cases. in other words, the more cases, the more deaths and the less cases, the less deaths. but, eventually, we went onto states such as Alaska and California and noticed that California had by far the most cases in the country, making up 19% of total cases in the US. Second was NY and third was Florida. and lastly, with analysis #2, it was interesting to see that the rank in country-wide deaths went from CA at #1, TX at #2, and PA at #3. as a group, we believed NY and FL would hit the #2 and #3 spots but there are always underlying factors such as population density, weather & climate, and many others that can change the tides of you data and expectations.
